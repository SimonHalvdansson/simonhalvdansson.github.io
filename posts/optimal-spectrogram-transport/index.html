		<h1>Notions of time-aware signal distance functions - optimal spectrogram transport</h1>
		<div class="subtitle monospace">By Simon Halvdansson&nbsp;|&nbsp;Aug. 2025</div>

		<p>
			Determining if two vectors are near each other is generally a straightforward problem - Euclidean distance or cosine similarity are standard solutions. We are interested in the special case where the vector indices indicate time, i.e., vectors which represent time series data or signals. There are specialized metrics available for this class of vectors but as we will see their preference for translations over modulations poses an issue for signals which exhibits some form of <i>time-frequency</i> structure or time-warying oscillations such as those related to audio, radar, EEG, seismic activity or vibrations.
		</p>

		<p>
			We will make the case that an appropriate solution is <i>optimal transport distance between spectrograms</i> through examples where other methods fail.

		</div>

		<p>
			We will go over the problems with naive Euclidean $\ell^2$ distance, the standard solution which is called <i>dynamic time warping (DWT)</i>, why it does not work when frequency changes are involved, and one way to solve it using the tools from optimal transport applied to spectrograms.
		</p>

		<hr class="squiggly-line"/>
		<h2>Why look at distances between signals?</h2>

		<p>
			The standard motivation for looking at distances between signals is to perform some sort of clustering/classification/anomaly detection task. We could get around the need for a distance function by first applying some form of encoding. The machine learning approach would then be to use a learned encoding, such as either simple fully connected or convolutions layers or something more involved like <a href="example.com">wav2vec</a>, to obtain a latent representation of the data which is easier to work with directly. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			There are obvious interpretability benefits to a distance function which works directly on the signal, being able to directly query the distance between two signals makes a model considerably more explainable. A distance function which makes sense for the domain of the data also ideally improved the inductive bias of the model and can help reduce complexity. 
		</p>

		<hr class="squiggly-line"/>
		<h2>The problem with Euclidean distance</h2>

		<p>
			From a time-frequency perspective there are two insurmountable problems with looking at Euclidean distance between signals (one in time, one in frequency), both best explained by examples. Consider first the case of two signals, each with a well localized peak at slightly different locations. A (low-dimensional) one would be $x_1 = (0,0,0,1,0)$ and $x_2 = (0,0,1,0,0)$. Clearly the Euclidean distance between these two vectors is $2$ but they are considerably closer than $(1,0,0,0,0)$ and $(0,0,0,0,1)$ as any sane person should conclude. Note that this is not necessarily the case if the indices do not have some temporal meaning.
		</p>

		<p>
			The other problem with Euclidean distance is a direct corollary of <a href="example.com">Parseval identity</a> and boils down to pure tone sinusoids being orthogonal. This means that a 101 Hz pure tone and a 200 Hz pure tone both have the same distance to a 100 Hz pure tone.

		<h2>Dynamic time warping (DTW)</h2>
		<p>
			Romain Tavenard wrote an excellent <a href="https://rtavenar.github.io/blog/dtw.html" target="_blank">overview</a> of DTW which I would refer to for details. On a high level, the dynamic time warping distance between two signals $x_1$ and $x_2$ is realized by minimizing the distance between $\pi(x_1)$ and $x_2$ where $\pi$ is a sequence of index pairs which

		<h2>Optimal transport</h2>

		<p>
			The ideas behind optimal transport, sometimes called the <i>earth mover's distance</i> or <i>Wasserstein distance</i> originate.
		</p>

		<p>
			Say something about perhaps seeing waveform-level OT as a generalization of DTW
		</p>

		<hr class="squiggly-line"/>
		<h2>Optimal spectrogram transport</h2>

		<p>
			The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a> of a signal is a 2-dimensional representation, meaning a function $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, where the axes represent time and frequency.
